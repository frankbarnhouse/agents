- Serves: 8–10
- Difficulty: Easy
- Prep: 30 mins
- Cook: 30–35 mins

## Ingredients

For the pastry
- 100g chilled butter (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg, separated (use the yolk in the pastry; save the white to brush)
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar
- Very cold water, 1 tbsp at a time

For the filling & topping
- 394g caramel (or dulce de leche)
- 4 bananas, sliced
- 300ml double cream
- Dark chocolate, for grating (optional)

## Method (summary)

1. Make the pastry: pulse the chilled butter and flour in a food processor until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the egg yolk and caster sugar and pulse to combine. Add very cold water 1 tbsp at a time, pulsing, until the dough just comes together.

2. Bring the dough together on the work surface with your hands until smooth. Wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes.

3. Heat the oven to 190°C/170°C fan/gas 5 (190°C listed on source). Grease a 23cm loose-bottomed fluted tart tin. Roll out the chilled pastry and line the tin, leaving about ½ cm overhang; trim with scissors.

4. Line the base with baking parchment and baking beans (or uncooked rice) and blind-bake for 15 minutes. Remove the paper and beans, brush the base with the reserved beaten egg white, and return to the oven for a further 15–20 minutes until crisp and golden. Leave to cool completely (the case can be made a day ahead).

5. Spread half the caramel over the cooled pastry case, arrange a layer of sliced bananas, then spoon over the remaining caramel. Chill in the fridge to set the filling.

6. Whip the double cream until billowy/thick and spoon over the top of the tart just before serving. Finely grate dark chocolate over the cream if using.

## Notes & tips
- You can use ready-made dulce de leche or make caramel from condensed milk (follow safe instructions for boiling condensed milk if you choose that method).
- The pastry case can be made ahead and frozen (without filling). If short on time, a buttery biscuit base is a quicker alternative.
- Best to add the whipped cream on the day you serve the pie to keep it fresh.

Enjoy your banoffee pie!
